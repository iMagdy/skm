# Installation

Ktesio is a Rust CLI. It works on macOS, Linux, and Windows as long as `git` is available on `PATH`.

## Prerequisites

- Git

Rust is only required when installing through Cargo or from source.

## Install with the Installer

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.ktesio.dev/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows with PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://cli.ktesio.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer preserves an existing Ktesio install channel when it can:

- Homebrew installs are updated with `brew upgrade imagdy/tap/ktesio`.
- Cargo installs are updated with `cargo install ktesio --force`.
- Manual binary installs are replaced in their existing writable directory.

For new macOS and Linux installs, the installer prefers Homebrew, then Cargo,
then a prebuilt GitHub Release binary. For new Windows installs, it prefers
Cargo, then a prebuilt GitHub Release binary.

Installer overrides:

```bash
KTESIO_INSTALL_METHOD=binary curl -fsSL https://cli.ktesio.dev/install.sh | sh
KTESIO_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin" curl -fsSL https://cli.ktesio.dev/install.sh | sh
KTESIO_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1 curl -fsSL https://cli.ktesio.dev/install.sh | sh
```

`KTESIO_INSTALL_METHOD` accepts `auto`, `brew`, `cargo`, or `binary` on macOS
and Linux. Windows accepts `auto`, `cargo`, or `binary`.

The installer does not install Homebrew, Rust, Cargo, Git, or shell profile
entries. If it installs a binary into a directory that is not on `PATH`, it
prints the directory to add.

## Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iMagdy/ktesio.git
cd ktesio
cargo install --path .
```

Verify:

```bash
kt --version
kt --help
```

## Install from crates.io

```bash
cargo install ktesio
```

The crates.io package is named `ktesio`; it installs the `kt` binary.

## Install from a Release

Download the archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/iMagdy/ktesio/releases), then unpack it and place the `kt` binary on your `PATH`.

Release archives use this naming pattern:

```text
ktesio-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz
ktesio-<tag>-<target>.zip
```

Each release also includes `.sha256` files and an aggregate checksum file.

## Install with Homebrew

After a release is published to the Homebrew tap:

```bash
brew install imagdy/tap/ktesio
```

The formula installs the prebuilt macOS or Linux release archive for your platform.

## Platform Notes

- macOS may require Xcode Command Line Tools when building from source.
- Windows users should install Git for Windows and make sure `git.exe` is on `PATH`.
- Linux users may need standard build tools for Rust crates.
